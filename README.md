# TiDB in Kubernetes Documentation

This repository stores all the source files of TiDB in Kubernetes documentation. That is, the documentation for [TiDB Operator](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator).

- `en`: [documentation in English](/en/TOC.md)
- `zh`: [documentation in Chinese](/zh/TOC.md)

## Documentation versions

Currently, we maintain the following three versions of documentation, each with a separate branch:

| Branch name | Version description |
| :--- | :-- |
| `master` | the latest development version |
| `release-1.1` | the 1.1 rc version |
| `release-1.0` | the latest 1.0 stable version |

> **Note:**
>
> - Previously, we maintain the TiDB in Kubernetes documentation in the [docs](https://github.com/pingcap/docs) and [docs-cn](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn) repository.
> - Since the end of March 2020, the TiDB in Kubernetes documentation is moved in this repository, and separated in the above three branches.
