# TiDB Operator 1.0 Beta.3 Release Notes

Release date: June 6, 2019

TiDB Operator version: 1.0.0-beta.3

## v1.0.0-beta.3 Whatâ€™s New

### Action Required

- ACTION REQUIRED: `nodeSelectorRequired` was removed from values.yaml.
- ACTION REQUIRED:  Comma-separated values support in `nodeSelector` has been dropped, please use new-added `affinity` field which has a more expressive syntax.

### A lot of stability cases added

- ConfigMap rollout
- One PD replicas
- Stop TiDB Operator itself
- TiDB stable scheduling
- Disaster tolerance and data regions disaster tolerance
- Fix many bugs of stability test

### Features added

- Introduce ConfigMap rollout management. With the feature gate open, configuration file changes will be automatically applied to the cluster via a rolling update. Currently, the `scheduler` and `replication` configurations of PD can not be changed via ConfigMap rollout. You can use `pd-ctl` to change these values instead, see [#487](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/487) for details.
- Support stable scheduling for pods of TiDB members in tidb-scheduler.
- Support adding additional pod annotations for PD/TiKV/TiDB,  e.g. [fluentbit.io/parser](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/filter/kubernetes#kubernetes-annotations).
- Support the affinity feature of k8s which can define the rule of assigning pods to nodes
- Allow pausing during TiDB upgrade

### Documentation improved

- GCP one-command deployment
- Refine user guides
- Improve GKE, AWS, Aliyun guide

### Pass User Acceptance Tests

### Other improvements

- Upgrade default TiDB version to v3.0.0-rc.1
- fix bug in reporting assigned nodes of tidb members
- `tkctl get` can show cpu usage correctly now
- Adhoc backup now appends the start time to the PVC name by default.
- add the privileged option for TiKV pod
- `tkctl upinfo` can show nodeIP podIP port now
- get TS and use it before full backup using mydumper
- Fix capabilities issue for `tkctl debug` command
