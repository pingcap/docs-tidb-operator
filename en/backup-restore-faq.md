# FAQs on EBS Snapshot Backup and Restore

This document describes the common questions that occur during EBS snapshot backup and restore and the solutions.

## Backup issues

You might encounter the following problems during EBS snapshot backup:

- [Backup failed after an upgrade of the TiDB cluster](#backup-failed-after-an-upgrade-of-the-tidb-cluster)
- [Failed to start a backup or the backup failed immediately after it started](#failed-to-start-a-backup-or-the-backup-failed-immediately-after-it-started)
- [The backup CR of a failed task could not be deleted](#the-backup-cr-of-a-failed-task-could-not-be-deleted)
- [Backup failed](#backup-failed)

### Backup failed after an upgrade of the TiDB cluster

After the TiDB cluster is upgraded from an earlier version to v6.5.0+, the backup using volume snapshots might fail with the following error:

```shell
error="min resolved ts not enabled"
```

The backup failed because the PD configuration `min-resolved-ts-persistence-interval` is set to 0, which means that the globally consistent min-resolved-ts service of PD is disabled. The EBS volume snapshot requires this service to obtain the globally consistent timestamp of the cluster. You can check this configuration using either the SQL statement or pd-ctl:

- Check the PD configuration `min-resolved-ts-persistence-interval` using the SQL statement:

    ```sql
    SHOW CONFIG WHERE type='pd' AND name LIKE '%min-resolved%'
    ```

    If the globally consistent min-resolved-ts service is disabled, the following output is displayed:

    ```sql
    +------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-------+
    | Type | Instance                                       | Name                                           | Value |
    +------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-------+
    | pd   | basic-pd-0.basic-pd-peer.tidb-cluster.svc:2379 | pd-server.min-resolved-ts-persistence-interval | 0s    |
    +------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-------+
    1 row in set (0.03 sec)
    ```

    If this service is enabled, the following output is displayed:

    ```sql
    +------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-------+
    | Type | Instance                                       | Name                                           | Value |
    +------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-------+
    | pd   | basic-pd-0.basic-pd-peer.tidb-cluster.svc:2379 | pd-server.min-resolved-ts-persistence-interval | 1s    |
    +------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+-------+
    1 row in set (0.03 sec)
    ```

- Check the PD configuration `min-resolved-ts-persistence-interval` using pd-ctl:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n ${namespace} exec -it ${pd-pod-name} -- /pd-ctl min-resolved-ts
    ```

    If the globally consistent min-resolved-ts service is disabled, the following output is displayed:

    ```json
    {
      "min_resolved_ts": 439357537983660033,
      "persist_interval": "0s"
    }
    ```

    If this service is enabled, the following output is displayed:

    ```json
    {
      "is_real_time": true,
      "min_resolved_ts": 439357519607365634,
      "persist_interval": "1s"
    }
    ```

Solution:

- Solution 1: Modify the configuration of `min-resolved-ts-persistence-interval` using the SQL statement:

    ```sql
    SET CONFIG pd `pd-server.min-resolved-ts-persistence-interval` = "1s"
    ```

- Solution 2: Modify the configuration of `min-resolved-ts-persistence-interval` using pd-ctl:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n ${namespace} exec -it ${pd-pod-name} -- /pd-ctl config set min-resolved-ts-persistence-interval 1s
    ```

### Failed to start a backup or the backup failed immediately after it started

Issue: [#4781](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/issues/4781)

- Symptom 1: After the backup CRD yaml file is applied, the pod and job are not created, and the backup cannot be started.

    1. Run the following command to check the pod of TiDB Operator:

        ```shell
        kubectl get po -n ${namespace}
        ```

    2. Run the following command to check the log of `tidb-controller-manager`:

        ```shell
        kubectl -n ${namespace} logs ${tidb-controller-manager}
        ```

    3. Check whether the log contains the following error message:

        ```shell
        metadata.annotations: Too long: must have at most 262144 bytes, spec.template.annotations: Too long: must have  at most 262144 bytes
        ```

    Cause: TiDB uses annotations to pass in the PVC or PV configuration, and the annotation of a backup job should not exceed 256 KB. When a TiKV cluster is excessively large, the configuration of PVC or PV will be larger than 256 KB. As a result, calling Kubernetes API fails.

- Symptom 2: After the backup CRD yaml file is applied, the pod and job are successfully created, but the backup failed immediately.

    Check the log of the backup job as described in symptom 1. The error message is as follows:

    ```shell
    exec /entrypoint.sh: argument list too long
    ```

    Cause: In TiDB Operator, before the backup pod starts, the PVC or PV configuration is injected to the environment variables of the backup pod. Then the backup task starts. The environment variables cannot exceed 1 MB. Therefore, when the configuration of PVC or PV is larger than 1 MB, the backup pod cannot get the environment variables and the backup fails.

    Scenario: This issue occurs when the TiKV cluster is excessively large (40+ TiKV nodes) or too many volumes have been configured, and the TiDB Operator is v1.4.0-beta.2 or earlier.

Solution: Upgrade TiDB Operator to the latest version.

### The backup CR of a failed task could not be deleted

Issue: [#4778](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/issues/4778)

Symptom: Deleting the backup CR is stuck.

Scenario: This issue occurs when the TiDB Operator is v1.4.0-beta.2 or earlier.

Solution: Upgrade TiDB Operator to the latest version.

### Backup failed

Issue: [#13838](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/13838)

Symptom: After the backup CRD yaml file is applied, the pod and job are successfully created, but the backup failed immediately.

Check whether the log contains the following error:

```shell
GC safepoint 437271276493996032 exceed TS 437270540511608835
```

Scenario: This issue occurs when you initiate backup tasks using volumes in a large cluster (20+ TiKV nodes), after you perform large-scale data restore using BR.

Solution: Start the grafana `${cluster-name}`-TiKV-Details panel. Unfold `Resolved-TS` and check the `Max Resolved TS gap` panel. Locate the Max Resolved TS with a large value (greater than 1 min). Then restart the corresponding TiKV.

> **Note:**
>
> If the backup fails, intermediate files such as `clustermeta` or `backup.lock` might persist. You need to clean them up before using the same backup directory to perform the backup again.

## Restore issues

You might encounter the following problems during EBS snapshot restore:

- [Failed to restore the cluster with the error `keepalive watchdog timeout`](#failed-to-restore-the-cluster-with-the-error-keepalive-watchdog-timeout)
- [Restore period is excessively long (longer than 2 hours)](#restore-period-is-excessively-long-longer-than-2-hours)

### Failed to restore the cluster with the error `keepalive watchdog timeout`

Symptom: The subtasks of BR data restore failed. The first restore subtask succeeded (volume complete) but the second one failed. The following log information is found in the failed task:

```shell
error="rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = keepalive watchdog timeout"
```

Scenario: This issue occurs when the data volume is large and the TiDB cluster version is v6.3.0.

Solution:

1. Upgrade the TiDB cluster to v6.4.0 or later.

2. Edit the configuration file of the TiDB cluster and increase the value of TiKV's `keepalive`:

    ```yaml
    config: |
      [server]
        grpc-keepalive-time = "500s"
        grpc-keepalive-timeout = "10s"
    ```

### Restore period is excessively long (longer than 2 hours)

Scenario: This issue occurs when the TiDB cluster version is v6.3.0 or v6.4.0.

Solution:

1. Upgrade the TiDB cluster to v6.5.0+.

2. In BR spec, temporarily increase the volume performance for restore, and then manually degrade the performance after the restore is completed. Specifically, you can specify parameters to get higher volume configuration, such as specifying `--volume-iops=8000`, `--volume-throughput=600`, or other configurations.

    ```yaml
    spec:
      backupType: full
      restoreMode: volume-snapshot
      serviceAccount: tidb-backup-manager
      toolImage: pingcap/br:v8.1.0
      br:
        cluster: basic
        clusterNamespace: tidb-cluster
        sendCredToTikv: false
    options:
    - --volume-type=gp3
    - --volume-iops=8000
    - --volume-throughput=600
    ```
