# Back up Data to PV Using BR

This document describes how to back up the data of a TiDB cluster in Kubernetes to [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PVs). [BR](https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/br/backup-and-restore-tool/) is used to get the backup of the TiDB cluster, and then the backup data is sent to PVs.

PVs in this documentation can be any [Kubernetes supported Persistent Volume types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes). This document uses NFS as an example PV type.

The backup method described in this document is implemented using Custom Resource Definition (CRD) in TiDB Operator v1.1 or later versions.

## Ad-hoc backup

Ad-hoc backup supports both full backup and incremental backup. It describes the backup by creating a `Backup` Custom Resource (CR) object. TiDB Operator performs the specific backup operation based on this `Backup` object. If an error occurs during the backup process, TiDB Operator does not retry, and you need to handle this error manually.

This document provides examples in which the data of the `demo1` TiDB cluster in the `test1` Kubernetes namespace is backed up to NFS.

### Prerequisites for ad-hoc backup

> **Note:**
>
> If TiDB Operator >= v1.1.10 && TiDB >= v4.0.8, BR will automatically adjust `tikv_gc_life_time`. You do not need to configure `spec.tikvGCLifeTime` and `spec.from` fields in the `Backup` CR. In addition, you can skip the steps of creating the `backup-demo1-tidb-secret` secret and [configuring database account privileges](#required-database-account-privileges).

1. Download [backup-rbac.yaml](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/blob/master/manifests/backup/backup-rbac.yaml), and execute the following command to create the role-based access control (RBAC) resources in the `test1` namespace:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-rbac.yaml -n test1
    ```

2. Create the `backup-demo1-tidb-secret` secret which stores the root account and password needed to access the TiDB cluster:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic backup-demo1-tidb-secret --from-literal=password=<password> --namespace=test1
    ```

3. Ensure that the NFS server is accessible from your Kubernetes cluster, and TiKV is configured to mount the same NFS server directory to the same local path as in backup jobs. To mount NFS for TiKV, refer to the configuration below:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      tikv:
        additionalVolumes:
        # specify volume types that are supported by Kubernetes, Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes
        - name: nfs
          nfs:
            server: 192.168.0.2
            path: /nfs
        additionalVolumeMounts:
        # this must match `name` in `additionalVolumes`
        - name: nfs
          mountPath: /nfs
    ```

### Required database account privileges

* The `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges of the `mysql.tidb` table: Before and after the backup, the `Backup` CR needs a database account with these privileges to adjust the GC time.

### Process of ad-hoc backup

1. Create the `Backup` CR, and back up cluster data to NFS as described below:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-nfs.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-nfs.yaml` is as follows:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-nfs
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      # # backupType: full
      # # Only needed for TiDB Operator < v1.1.10 or TiDB < v4.0.8
      # from:
      #   host: ${tidb-host}
      #   port: ${tidb-port}
      #   user: ${tidb-user}
      #   secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
      br:
        cluster: demo1
        clusterNamespace: test1
        # logLevel: info
        # statusAddr: ${status-addr}
        # concurrency: 4
        # rateLimit: 0
        # checksum: true
        # options:
        # - --lastbackupts=420134118382108673
      local:
        prefix: backup-nfs
        volume:
          name: nfs
          nfs:
            server: ${nfs_server_ip}
            path: /nfs
        volumeMount:
          name: nfs
          mountPath: /nfs
    ```

    In the example above, `spec.local` refers to the configuration related to PVs. For more information about PV configuration, refer to [Local storage fields](backup-restore-overview.md#local-storage-fields).

    In the example above, some parameters in `spec.br` can be ignored, such as `logLevel`, `statusAddr`, `concurrency`, `rateLimit`, `checksum`, and `timeAgo`. For more information about BR configuration, refer to [BR fields](backup-restore-overview.md#br-fields).

    Since TiDB Operator v1.1.6, if you want to back up data incrementally, you only need to specify the last backup timestamp `--lastbackupts` in `spec.br.options`. For the limitations of incremental backup, refer to [Use BR to Back up and Restore Data](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-tool#back-up-incremental-data).

    For more information about the `Backup` CR fields, refer to [Backup CR fields](backup-restore-overview.md#backup-cr-fields).

    This example backs up all data in the TiDB cluster to NFS.

2. After creating the `Backup` CR, use the following command to check the backup status:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get bk -n test1 -owide
    ```

## Scheduled full backup

You can set a backup policy to perform scheduled backups of the TiDB cluster, and set a backup retention policy to avoid excessive backup items. A scheduled full backup is described by a custom `BackupSchedule` CR object. A full backup is triggered at each backup time point. Its underlying implementation is the ad-hoc full backup.

### Prerequisites for scheduled full backup

The prerequisites for the scheduled full backup is the same with the [prerequisites for ad-hoc backup](#prerequisites-for-ad-hoc-backup).

### Process of scheduled full backup

1. Create the `BackupSchedule` CR, and back up cluster data as described below:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-schedule-nfs.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-schedule-nfs.yaml` is as follows:

   ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: BackupSchedule
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-schedule-nfs
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      #maxBackups: 5
      #pause: true
      maxReservedTime: "3h"
      schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
      backupTemplate:
        # Only needed for TiDB Operator < v1.1.10 or TiDB < v4.0.8
        # from:
        #   host: ${tidb_host}
        #   port: ${tidb_port}
        #   user: ${tidb_user}
        #   secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
        br:
          cluster: demo1
          clusterNamespace: test1
          # logLevel: info
          # statusAddr: ${status-addr}
          # concurrency: 4
          # rateLimit: 0
          # checksum: true
        local:
          prefix: backup-nfs
          volume:
            name: nfs
            nfs:
              server: ${nfs_server_ip}
              path: /nfs
          volumeMount:
            name: nfs
            mountPath: /nfs
    ```

2. After creating the scheduled full backup, use the following command to check the backup status:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get bks -n test1 -owide
    ```

    Use the following command to check all the backup items:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get bk -l tidb.pingcap.com/backup-schedule=demo1-backup-schedule-nfs -n test1
    ```

From the example above, you can see that the `backupSchedule` configuration consists of two parts. One is the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, and the other is `backupTemplate`.

`backupTemplate` specifies the configuration related to the cluster and remote storage, which is the same as the `spec` configuration of [the `Backup` CR](backup-restore-overview.md#backup-cr-fields). For the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, refer to [BackupSchedule CR fields](backup-restore-overview.md#backupschedule-cr-fields).

## Delete the backup CR

Refer to [Delete the Backup CR](backup-restore-overview.md#delete-the-backup-cr).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problem during the backup process, refer to [Common Deployment Failures](deploy-failures.md).
