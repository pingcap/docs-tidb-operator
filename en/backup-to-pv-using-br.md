# Back up Data to PV

This document describes how to back up the data of a TiDB cluster in Kubernetes to [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PVs). PVs in this documentation can be any [Kubernetes supported PV types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes). This document uses NFS as an example PV type.

The backup method described in this document is implemented based on CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) in TiDB Operator. For the underlying implementation, [BR](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-tool) is used to get the backup data of the TiDB cluster, and then send the data to PVs. BR stands for Backup & Restore, which is a command-line tool for distributed backup and recovery of the TiDB cluster data.

## User scenarios

If you have the following backup needs, you can use BR to make an [ad-hoc backup](#ad-hoc-backup) or [scheduled full backup](#scheduled-full-backup) of the TiDB cluster data to PVs:

- To back up a large volume of data at a fast speed
- To get a direct backup of data as SST files (key-value pairs)

For other backup needs, refer to [Backup and Restore Overview](backup-restore-overview.md) to choose an appropriate backup method.

> **Note:**
>
> - BR is only applicable to TiDB v3.1 or later releases.
> - Data that is backed up using BR can only be restored to TiDB instead of other databases.

## Ad-hoc backup

Ad-hoc backup supports both full backup and incremental backup.

To get an Ad-hoc backup, you need to create a `Backup` Custom Resource (CR) object to describe the backup details. Then, TiDB Operator performs the specific backup operation based on this `Backup` object. If an error occurs during the backup process, TiDB Operator does not retry, and you need to handle this error manually.

This document provides an example about how to back up the data of the `demo1` TiDB cluster in the `test1` Kubernetes namespace to NFS. The following are the detailed steps.

### Step 1: Prepare for an ad-hoc backup

1. Download [backup-rbac.yaml](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/blob/master/manifests/backup/backup-rbac.yaml) to the server that runs the backup task.

2. Execute the following command to create the role-based access control (RBAC) resources in the `test1` namespace:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-rbac.yaml -n test1
    ```

3. Make sure that the NFS server is accessible from your Kubernetes cluster, and you have configured TiKV to mount the same NFS server directory to the same local path as in backup jobs. To mount NFS for TiKV, refer to the configuration below:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```yaml
    spec:
      tikv:
        additionalVolumes:
        # Specify volume types that are supported by Kubernetes, Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes
        - name: nfs
          nfs:
            server: 192.168.0.2
            path: /nfs
        additionalVolumeMounts:
        # This must match `name` in `additionalVolumes`
        - name: nfs
          mountPath: /nfs
    ```

4. For a TiDB version earlier than v4.0.8, you also need to complete the following preparation steps. For TiDB v4.0.8 or a later version, skip these preparation steps.

    1. Make sure that you have the `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges on the `mysql.tidb` table of the backup database so that the `Backup` CR can adjust the GC time before and after the backup.

    2. Create the `backup-demo1-tidb-secret` secret to store the account and password to access the TiDB cluster:

        {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

        ```shell
        kubectl create secret generic backup-demo1-tidb-secret --from-literal=password=${password} --namespace=test1
        ```

### Step 2: Perform an ad-hoc backup

1. Create the `Backup` CR, and back up cluster data to NFS as described below:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-nfs.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-nfs.yaml` is as follows:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-nfs
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      # # backupType: full
      # # Only needed for TiDB Operator < v1.1.10 or TiDB < v4.0.8
      # from:
      #   host: ${tidb-host}
      #   port: ${tidb-port}
      #   user: ${tidb-user}
      #   secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
      br:
        cluster: demo1
        clusterNamespace: test1
        # logLevel: info
        # statusAddr: ${status-addr}
        # concurrency: 4
        # rateLimit: 0
        # checksum: true
        # options:
        # - --lastbackupts=420134118382108673
      local:
        prefix: backup-nfs
        volume:
          name: nfs
          nfs:
            server: ${nfs_server_ip}
            path: /nfs
        volumeMount:
          name: nfs
          mountPath: /nfs
    ```

    When configuring `backup-nfs.yaml`, note the following:

    * If you want to back up data incrementally, you only need to specify the last backup timestamp `--lastbackupts` in `spec.br.options`. For the limitations of incremental backup, refer to [Use BR to Back up and Restore Data](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-tool#back-up-incremental-data).

    * `spec.local` refers to the configuration related to PVs. For more information about PV configuration, refer to [Local storage fields](backup-restore-overview.md#local-storage-fields).

    * Some parameters in `spec.br` are optional, such as `logLevel`, `statusAddr`, `concurrency`, `rateLimit`, `checksum`, and `timeAgo`. For more information about `spec.br` fields, refer to [BR fields](backup-restore-overview.md#br-fields).

    * For v4.0.8 or a later version, BR can automatically adjust `tikv_gc_life_time`. You do not need to configure `spec.tikvGCLifeTime` and `spec.from` fields in the `Backup` CR.

    * For more information about the `Backup` CR fields, refer to [Backup CR fields](backup-restore-overview.md#backup-cr-fields).

2. After creating the `Backup` CR, TiDB Operator automatically starts the backup task. You can use the following command to check the backup status:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get bk -n test1 -owide
    ```

## Scheduled full backup

You can set a backup policy to perform scheduled backups of the TiDB cluster, and set a backup retention policy to avoid excessive backup items. A scheduled full backup is described by a custom `BackupSchedule` CR object. A full backup is triggered at each backup time point. Its underlying implementation is the ad-hoc full backup.

### Step 1: Prepare for a scheduled full backup

The steps to prepare for a scheduled full backup are the same as that of [Prepare for an ad-hoc backup](#step-1-prepare-for-an-ad-hoc-backup).

### Step 2: Perform a scheduled full backup

1. Create the `BackupSchedule` CR, and back up cluster data as described below:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-schedule-nfs.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-schedule-nfs.yaml` is as follows:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

   ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: BackupSchedule
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-schedule-nfs
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      #maxBackups: 5
      #pause: true
      maxReservedTime: "3h"
      schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
      backupTemplate:
        # Only needed for TiDB Operator < v1.1.10 or TiDB < v4.0.8
        # from:
        #   host: ${tidb_host}
        #   port: ${tidb_port}
        #   user: ${tidb_user}
        #   secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
        br:
          cluster: demo1
          clusterNamespace: test1
          # logLevel: info
          # statusAddr: ${status-addr}
          # concurrency: 4
          # rateLimit: 0
          # checksum: true
        local:
          prefix: backup-nfs
          volume:
            name: nfs
            nfs:
              server: ${nfs_server_ip}
              path: /nfs
          volumeMount:
            name: nfs
            mountPath: /nfs
    ```

    From the `backup-schedule-nfs.yaml` example above, you can see that the `backupSchedule` configuration consists of two parts. One is the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, and the other is `backupTemplate`.

    - For the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, refer to [BackupSchedule CR fields](backup-restore-overview.md#backupschedule-cr-fields).
    - `backupTemplate` specifies the configuration related to the cluster and remote storage, which is the same as the `spec` configuration of [the `Backup` CR](backup-restore-overview.md#backup-cr-fields).

2. After creating the scheduled full backup, use the following command to check the backup status:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get bks -n test1 -owide
    ```

    Use the following command to check all the backup items:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get bk -l tidb.pingcap.com/backup-schedule=demo1-backup-schedule-nfs -n test1
    ```

## Delete the backup CR

If you no longer need the backup CR, refer to [Delete the Backup CR](backup-restore-overview.md#delete-the-backup-cr).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problem during the backup process, refer to [Common Deployment Failures](deploy-failures.md).
