# Run Containers as a Non-Root User

In some Kubernetes environments, containers cannot be run as the root user. For security reasons, it is recommended to run containers as a non-root user in production environments to reduce the risk of potential attacks. This document describes how to configure containers to run as a non-root user using the [`securityContext`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).

## Configure containers related to TiDB Operator

For TiDB Operator containers, configure the `securityContext` in the Helm `values.yaml` file.

The following is an example configuration:

```yaml
controllerManager:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 2000
    fsGroup: 2000
```

## Configure containers generated by CR

For containers generated by Custom Resources (CRs), configure the `securityContext` in any CR, such as `PDGroup`, `TiDBGroup`, `TiKVGroup`, `TiFlashGroup`, `TiCDCGroup`, `Backup`, or `Restore`.

- For CRs such as `PDGroup`, `TiDBGroup`, `TiKVGroup`, `TiFlashGroup`, and `TiCDCGroup`, configure the `securityContext` using the Overlay method. The following is an example configuration for the `PDGroup` CR:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: core.pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: PDGroup
    metadata:
      name: pd
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          overlay:
            pod:
              spec:
                securityContext:
                  runAsUser: 1000
                  runAsGroup: 2000
                  fsGroup: 2000
    ```

- For CRs such as `Backup` and `Restore`, configure the `podSecurityContext` in the `spec` field. The following is an example configuration for the `Backup` CR:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: br.pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: backup
    spec:
      podSecurityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 2000
        fsGroup: 2000
    ```
