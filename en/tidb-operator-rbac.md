# RBAC rules required by TiDB Operator

The [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) rules implemented on Kubernetes use Role or ClusterRole for management, and use RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding to grant permissions to a user or a group of users.

## Manage TiDB clusters at the cluster level

If the default setting `clusterScoped=true` is unchanged during the TiDB Operator deployment, TiDB Operator manages all TiDB clusters within a Kubernetes cluster.

To check the ClusterRole created for TiDB Operator, run the following command:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl get clusterrole | grep tidb
```

The example output is as follows:

```shell
tidb-operator:tidb-controller-manager                                  2021-05-04T13:08:55Z
tidb-operator:tidb-scheduler                                           2021-05-04T13:08:55Z
```

In the output above:

* `tidb-operator:tidb-controller-manager` is the ClusterRole created for the `tidb-controller-manager` Pod.
* `tidb-operator:tidb-scheduler` is the ClusterRole created for the `tidb-scheduler` Pod.

### `tidb-controller-manager` ClusterRole permissions

The following table lists the permissions corresponding to the `tidb-controller-manager` ClusterRole.

## Manage TiDB clusters at the namespace level

If `clusterScoped=false` is set during the TiDB Operator deployment, TiDB Operator manages TiDB clusters at the Namespace level.

- To check the ClusterRole created for TiDB Operator, run the following command:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get clusterrole | grep tidb
    ```

    The output is as follows:

    ```shell
    tidb-operator:tidb-controller-manager                                  2021-05-04T13:08:55Z
    ```

    `tidb-operator:tidb-controller-manager` is the ClusterRole created for the `tidb-controller-manager` Pod.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > During the TiDB Operator deployment, if `controllerManager.clusterPermissions.nodes`, `controllerManager.clusterPermissions.persistentvolumes`, `controllerManager.clusterPermissions.storageclasses` are all set to `false`, TiDB operator will not create this ClusterRole.

- To check the roles created for TiDB Operator, run the following command:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get role -n tidb-admin
    ```

    The example output is as follows:

    ```shell
    tidb-admin    tidb-operator:tidb-controller-manager            2021-05-04T13:08:55Z
    tidb-admin    tidb-operator:tidb-scheduler                     2021-05-04T13:08:55Z
    ```

    In the output:

    * `tidb-operator:tidb-controller-manager` is the role created for the `tidb-controller-manager` Pod.
    * `tidb-operator:tidb-scheduler` is the role created for the `tidb-scheduler` Pod.

### `tidb-controller-manager` ClusterRole permissions
