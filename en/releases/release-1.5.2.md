# TiDB Operator 1.5.2 Release Notes

Release date: January 19, 2023

TiDB Operator version: 1.5.2

## New features

Starting from v1.5.2, TiDB Operator supports backing up and restoring the data of a TiDB cluster deployed across multiple AWS Kubernetes clusters to AWS storage using EBS volume snapshots. For more information, refer to [Back up Data Using EBS Snapshots across Multiple Kubernetes](../backup-by-ebs-snapshot-across-multiple-kubernetes.md) and [Restore Data Using EBS Snapshots across Multiple Kubernetes](../restore-from-ebs-snapshot-across-multiple-kubernetes.md). ([#5003](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/5003), [@BornChanger](https://github.com/BornChanger), [@WangLe1321](https://github.com/WangLe1321), [@YuJuncen](https://github.com/YuJuncen), [@csuzhangxc](https://github.com/csuzhangxc))

## Improvements

- `startScriptVersion: v2` supports waiting for Pod IP to match the one published to external DNS before starting a PD or TiKV to better support scenarios such as Stale Read ([#5381](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/5381), [@smineyev81](https://github.com/smineyev81))
- `startScriptVersion: v2` supports explicitly specifying PD addresses to better support scenarios where a TiDB cluster is deployed across Kubernetes ([#5400](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/5400), [@smineyev81](https://github.com/smineyev81))
- tidb-operator Helm Chart supports specifying resource lock for leader election when deploying Advanced StatefulSet ([#5448](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/5448), [@csuzhangxc](https://github.com/csuzhangxc))

## Bug fixes

- Fix the issue that changing meta information such as annotations and replacing volumes at the same time might cause a deadlock for TiDB Operator reconcile ([#5382](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/5382), [@anish-db](https://github.com/anish-db))
- Fix the issue that the PD member might be set to the wrong label when replacing volumes ([#5393](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/5393), [@anish-db](https://github.com/anish-db))
