# TiDB Operator 1.4.1 Release Notes

Release date: January 13, 2023

TiDB Operator version: 1.4.1

## New features

- Support cleaning up failed instances of PD, TiKV and TiFlash components by removing the failed Pods and PVCs to handle unplanned failures of Kubernetes nodes in auto failure recovery feature ([#4824](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4824), [@lalitkfk](https://github.com/lalitkfk))
