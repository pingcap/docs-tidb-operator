# TiDB Operator 1.4.0-beta.1 Release Notes

Release date: October 27, 2022

TiDB Operator version: 1.4.0-beta.1

## New Feature

- TiDB Operator supports snapshot backup and restore based on Amazon EBS (experimental) ([#4698](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4698), [@gozssky](https://github.com/gozssky)). This feature has the following benefits:

    - Reduce the impact of backup on QPS to less than 5%
    - Shorten the backup and restore time

## Bug fixes

- Fix the issue that the log backup checkpoint ts will not be updated after TiDB Operator restarts ([#4746](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4746), [@WizardXiao](https://github.com/WizardXiao))

- Fix the issue that log backup checkpoint ts will not be updated when TLS is enabled for the TiDB cluster ([#4716](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4716), [@WizardXiao](https://github.com/WizardXiao))
