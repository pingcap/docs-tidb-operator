Release date: December 2, 2022

TiDB Operator version: 1.4.0-beta.3

## New Feature

- Add experimental support for TiProxy ([#4693](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4693)), [@xhebox](https://github.com/xhebox)

- Snapshot backup and restore based on Amazon EBS becomes GA ([#4784](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4784), [@fengou1](https://github.com/fengou1)). This feature has the following benefits:
