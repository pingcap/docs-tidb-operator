# Use PD Recover to Recover the PD Cluster

[PD Recover](https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/reference/tools/pd-recover) is a disaster recovery tool of [PD](https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/architecture/#placement-driver-server), used to recover the PD cluster which cannot start or provide services normally.

## Download PD Recover

1. Download the official TiDB package:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    wget https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-${version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```

    In the command above, `${version}` is the version of the TiDB cluster, such as `v4.0.7`.

2. Unpack the TiDB package for installation:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    tar -xzf tidb-${version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```

    `pd-recover` is in the `tidb-${version}-linux-amd64/bin` directory.

## Recover the PD cluster

This section introduces how to recover the PD cluster using PD Recover.

### Get Cluster ID

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl get tc ${cluster_name} -n ${namespace} -o='go-template={{.status.clusterID}}{{"\n"}}'
```

Example:

```
kubectl get tc test -n test -o='go-template={{.status.clusterID}}{{"\n"}}'
6821434242797747735
```

### Get Alloc ID

When you use `pd-recover` to recover the PD cluster, you need to specify `alloc-id`. The value of `alloc-id` must be larger than the largest allocated ID (`Alloc ID`) of the original cluster.

1. Access the Prometheus monitoring data of the TiDB cluster by taking steps in [Access the monitoring data](monitor-a-tidb-cluster.md#access-the-monitoring-data).

2. Enter `pd_cluster_id` in the input box and click the `Execute` button to make a query. Get the largest value in the query result.

3. Multiply the largest value in the query result by `100`. Use the multiplied value as the `alloc-id` value specified when using `pd-recover`.

### Recover the PD Pod

1. Delete the Pod of the PD cluster.

    Execute the following command to set the value of `spec.pd.replicas` to `0`:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl edit tc ${cluster_name} -n ${namespace}
    ```

    Because the PD cluster is in an abnormal state, TiDB Operator cannot synchronize the change above to the PD StatefulSet. You need to execute the following command to set the `spec.replicas` of the PD StatefulSet to `0`.

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl edit sts ${cluster_name}-pd -n ${namespace}
    ```

    Execute the following command to confirm that the PD Pod is deleted:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod -n ${namespace}
    ```

2. After confirming that all PD Pods are deleted, execute the following command to delete the PVCs bound to the PD Pods:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/component=pd,app.kubernetes.io/instance=${cluster_name} -n ${namespace}
    ```

3. After the PVCs are deleted, scale out the PD cluster to one Pod:

    Execute the following command to set the value of `spec.pd.replicas` to `1`:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl edit tc ${cluster_name} -n ${namespace}
    ```

    Because the PD cluster is in an abnormal state, TiDB Operator cannot synchronize the change above to the PD StatefulSet. You need to execute the following command to set the `spec.replicas` of the PD StatefulSet to `1`.

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl edit sts ${cluster_name}-pd -n ${namespace}
    ```

    Execute the following command to confirm that the PD Pod is started:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod -n ${namespace}
    ```

### Recover the cluster

1. Execute the `port-forward` command to expose the PD service:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward -n ${namespace} svc/${cluster_name}-pd 2379:2379
    ```

2. Open a **new** terminal tab or window, enter the directory where `pd-recover` is located, and execute the `pd-recover` command to recover the PD cluster:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    ./pd-recover -endpoints http://127.0.0.1:2379 -cluster-id ${cluster_id} -alloc-id ${alloc_id}
    ```

    In the command above, `${cluster_id}` is the cluster ID got in [Get Cluster ID](#get-cluster-id). `${alloc_id}` is the largest value of `pd_cluster_id` (got in [Get Alloc ID](#get-alloc-id)) multiplied by `100`.

    After the `pd-recover` command is successfully executed, the following result is printed:

    ```shell
    recover success! please restart the PD cluster
    ```

3. Go back to the window where the `port-forward` command is executed, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop and exit.

### Restart the PD Pod

1. Delete the PD Pod:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl delete pod ${cluster_name}-pd-0 -n ${namespace}
    ```

2. After the Pod is started successfully, execute the `port-forward` command to expose the PD service:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward -n ${namespace} svc/${cluster_name}-pd 2379:2379
    ```

3. Open a **new** terminal tab or window, execute the following command to confirm the Cluster ID is the one got in [Get Cluster ID](#get-cluster-id).

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    curl 127.0.0.1:2379/pd/api/v1/cluster
    ```

4. Go back to the window where the `port-forward` command is executed, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop and exit.

### Increase the capacity of the PD cluster

Execute the following command to set the value of `spec.pd.replicas` to the desired number of Pods:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl edit tc ${cluster_name} -n ${namespace}
```

### Restart TiDB and TiKV

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/component=tidb,app.kubernetes.io/instance=${cluster_name} -n ${namespace} &&
kubectl delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/component=tikv,app.kubernetes.io/instance=${cluster_name} -n ${namespace}
```
