# Back up Data to S3-Compatible Storage Using Dumpling

This document describes how to back up the data of the TiDB cluster in Kubernetes to the S3-compatible storage. "Backup" in this document refers to full backup (ad-hoc full backup and scheduled full backup). For the underlying implementation, [Dumpling](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/export-or-backup-using-dumpling) is used to get the logic backup of the TiDB cluster, and then this backup data is sent to the S3-compatible storage.

The backup method described in this document is implemented based on CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) in TiDB Operator v1.1 or later versions.

## Ad-hoc full backup to S3-compatible storage

Ad-hoc full backup describes the backup by creating a `Backup` custom resource (CR) object. TiDB Operator performs the specific backup operation based on this `Backup` object. If an error occurs during the backup process, TiDB Operator does not retry and you need to handle this error manually.

For the current S3-compatible storage types, Ceph and Amazon S3 work normally as tested. Therefore, this document shows examples in which the data of the `demo1` TiDB cluster in the `test1` Kubernetes namespace is backed up to Ceph and Amazon S3 respectively.

### Prerequisites for ad-hoc full backup

1. Download [backup-rbac.yaml](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/blob/master/manifests/backup/backup-rbac.yaml), and execute the following command to create the role-based access control (RBAC) resources in the `test1` namespace:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-rbac.yaml -n test1
    ```

2. Grant permissions to the remote storage.

    To grant permissions to access S3-compatible remote storage, refer to [AWS account permissions](grant-permissions-to-remote-storage.md#aws-account-permissions).

    If you use Ceph as the backend storage for testing, you can grant permissions by [using AccessKey and SecretKey](grant-permissions-to-remote-storage.md#grant-permissions-by-accesskey-and-secretkey).

3. Create the `backup-demo1-tidb-secret` secret which stores the root account and password needed to access the TiDB cluster:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic backup-demo1-tidb-secret --from-literal=password=${password} --namespace=test1
    ```

### Required database account privileges

* The `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges of the `mysql.tidb` table: Before and after the backup, the `Backup` CR needs a database account with these privileges to adjust the GC time.
* SELECT
* RELOAD
* LOCK TABLES
* REPLICATION CLIENT

### Ad-hoc backup process

> **Note:**
>
> Because of the `rclone` [issue](https://rclone.org/s3/#key-management-system-kms), if the backup data is stored in Amazon S3 and the `AWS-KMS` encryption is enabled, you need to add the following `spec.s3.options` configuration to the YAML file in the examples of this section:
>
> ```yaml
> spec:
>   ...
>   s3:
>     ...
>     options:
>     - --ignore-checksum
> ```

+ Create the `Backup` CR, and back up cluster data to Amazon S3 by importing AccessKey and SecretKey to grant permissions:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-s3.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-s3.yaml` is as follows:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-s3
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      from:
        host: ${tidb_host}
        port: ${tidb_port}
        user: ${tidb_user}
        secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
      s3:
        provider: aws
        secretName: s3-secret
        region: ${region}
        bucket: ${bucket}
        # prefix: ${prefix}
        # storageClass: STANDARD_IA
        # acl: private
        # endpoint:

    #  tableFilter:
    #  - "test.*"
      # storageClassName: local-storage
      storageSize: 10Gi
    ```

+ Create the `Backup` CR, and back up data to Ceph by importing AccessKey and SecretKey to grant permissions:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-s3.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-s3.yaml` is as follows:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-s3
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      from:
        host: ${tidb_host}
        port: ${tidb_port}
        user: ${tidb_user}
        secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
      s3:
        provider: ceph
        secretName: s3-secret
        endpoint: ${endpoint}
        # prefix: ${prefix}
        bucket: ${bucket}
    # dumpling:
    #  options:

    #  - --rows=10000
    #  tableFilter:
    #  - "test.*"
      # storageClassName: local-storage
      storageSize: 10Gi
    ```

+ Create the `Backup` CR, and back up data to Amazon S3 by binding IAM with Pod to grant permissions:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-s3.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-s3.yaml` is as follows:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
    name: demo1-backup-s3
    namespace: test1
    annotations:
        iam.amazonaws.com/role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/user
    spec:
    backupType: full
    from:
        host: ${tidb_host}
        port: ${tidb_port}
        user: ${tidb_user}
        secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
    s3:
        provider: aws
        region: ${region}
        bucket: ${bucket}
        # prefix: ${prefix}
        # storageClass: STANDARD_IA
        # acl: private
        # endpoint:

    #  tableFilter:
    #  - "test.*"
      # storageClassName: local-storage
      storageSize: 10Gi
    ```

+ Create the `Backup` CR, and back up data to Amazon S3 by binding IAM with ServiceAccount to grant permissions:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```yaml
    kubectl apply -f backup-s3.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-s3.yaml` is as follows:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
    name: demo1-backup-s3
    namespace: test1
    spec:
    backupType: full
    serviceAccount: tidb-backup-manager
    from:
        host: ${tidb_host}
        port: ${tidb_port}
        user: ${tidb_user}
        secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
    s3:
        provider: aws
        region: ${region}
        bucket: ${bucket}
        # prefix: ${prefix}
        # storageClass: STANDARD_IA
        # acl: private
        # endpoint:
    # dumpling:
    #  options:
    #  - --threads=16
    #  - --rows=10000
    #  tableFilter:
    #  - "test.*"
      # storageClassName: local-storage
      storageSize: 10Gi
    ```

In the examples above, all data of the TiDB cluster is exported and backed up to Amazon S3 or Ceph. You can ignore the `acl`, `endpoint`, and `storageClass` fields in the Amazon S3 configuration. Other S3-compatible storages can also use a configuration similar to that of Amazon S3. You can also leave the fields empty if you do not need to configure them, as shown in the above Ceph configuration. For more information about S3-compatible storage configuration, refer to [S3 storage fields](backup-restore-overview.md#s3-storage-fields).

`spec.dumpling` refers to Dumpling-related configuration. You can specify Dumpling's operation parameters in the `options` field. See [Dumpling Option list](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dumpling-overview#option-list-of-dumpling) for more information. These configuration items of Dumpling can be ignored by default. When these items are not specified, the default values of `options` fields are as follows:

```
options:
- --threads=16
- --rows=10000
```

For more information about the `Backup` CR fields, refer to [Backup CR fields](backup-restore-overview.md#backup-cr-fields).

After creating the `Backup` CR, use the following command to check the backup status:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl get bk -n test1 -owide
```

## Scheduled full backup to S3-compatible storage

You can set a backup policy to perform scheduled backups of the TiDB cluster, and set a backup retention policy to avoid excessive backup items. A scheduled full backup is described by a custom `BackupSchedule` CR object. A full backup is triggered at each backup time point. Its underlying implementation is the ad-hoc full backup.

### Prerequisites for scheduled backup

The prerequisites for the scheduled backup is the same as the [prerequisites for ad-hoc full backup](#prerequisites-for-ad-hoc-full-backup).

### Scheduled backup process

> **Note:**
>
> Because of the `rclone` [issue](https://rclone.org/s3/#key-management-system-kms), if the backup data is stored in Amazon S3 and the `AWS-KMS` encryption is enabled, you need to add the following `spec.backupTemplate.s3.options` configuration to the YAML file in the examples of this section:
>
> ```yaml
> spec:
>   ...
>   backupTemplate:
>     ...
>     s3:
>       ...
>       options:
>       - --ignore-checksum
> ```

+ Create the `BackupSchedule` CR to enable the scheduled full backup to Amazon S3 by importing AccessKey and SecretKey to grant permissions:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-schedule-s3.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-schedule-s3.yaml` is as follows:

    ```

After creating the scheduled full backup, you can use the following command to check the backup status:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl get bks -n test1 -owide
```

You can use the following command to check all the backup items:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl get bk -l tidb.pingcap.com/backup-schedule=demo1-backup-schedule-s3 -n test1
```

From the example above, you can see that the `backupSchedule` configuration consists of two parts. One is the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, and the other is `backupTemplate`.

`backupTemplate` specifies the configuration related to the cluster and remote storage, which is the same as the `spec` configuration of [the `Backup` CR](backup-restore-overview.md#backup-cr-fields). For the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, refer to [BackupSchedule CR fields](backup-restore-overview.md#backupschedule-cr-fields).

> **Note:**
>
> TiDB Operator creates a PVC used for both ad-hoc full backup and scheduled full backup. The backup data is stored in PV first and then uploaded to remote storage. If you want to delete this PVC after the backup is completed, you can refer to [Delete Resource](cheat-sheet.md#delete-resources) to delete the backup Pod first, and then delete the PVC.
>
> If the backup data is successfully uploaded to remote storage, TiDB Operator automatically deletes the local data. If the upload fails, the local data is retained.

## Delete the backup CR

Refer to [Delete the Backup CR](backup-restore-overview.md#delete-the-backup-cr).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problem during the backup process, refer to [Common Deployment Failures](deploy-failures.md).
