# Back up Data to Azure Blob Storage Using BR

This document describes how to back up the data of a TiDB cluster in Kubernetes to Azure Blob Storage.

The backup method described in this document is implemented based on CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) in TiDB Operator. For the underlying implementation, [BR](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-tool) is used to get the backup data of the TiDB cluster, and then send the data to Azure Blob Storage. BR stands for Backup & Restore, which is a command-line tool for distributed backup and recovery of the TiDB cluster data.

## Usage scenarios

If you have the following backup needs, you can use BR to make an [ad-hoc backup](#ad-hoc-backup) or [scheduled full backup](#scheduled-full-backup) of the TiDB cluster data to Azure Blob Storage.

- To back up a large volume of data at a fast speed
- To get a direct backup of data as SST files (key-value pairs)

For other backup needs, refer to [Backup and Restore Overview](backup-restore-overview.md) to choose an appropriate backup method.

> **Note:**
>
> - BR is only applicable to TiDB v3.1 or later releases.
> - Data that is backed up using BR can only be restored to TiDB instead of other databases.

## Ad-hoc backup

Ad-hoc backup supports both full backup and incremental backup.

To get an Ad-hoc backup, you need to create a `Backup` Custom Resource (CR) object to describe the backup details. Then, TiDB Operator performs the specific backup operation based on this `Backup` object. If an error occurs during the backup process, TiDB Operator does not retry, and you need to handle this error manually.

This document provides an example about how to back up the data of the `demo1` TiDB cluster in the `test1` Kubernetes namespace to Azure Blob Storage. The following are the detailed steps.

### Step 1. Prepare for an ad-hoc backup

1. Download [backup-rbac.yaml](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/blob/master/manifests/backup/backup-rbac.yaml), and execute the following command to create the role-based access control (RBAC) resources in the `test1` namespace:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-rbac.yaml -n test1
    ```

2. Grant permissions to the remote storage. You can grant permissions to Azure Blob Storage by two methods. For details, refer to [Azure account permissions](grant-permissions-to-remote-storage.md#azure-account-permissions).

3. For a TiDB version earlier than v4.0.8, you also need to complete the following preparation steps. For TiDB v4.0.8 or a later version, skip these preparation steps.

    1. Make sure that you have the `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges on the `mysql.tidb` table of the backup database so that the `Backup` CR can adjust the GC time before and after the backup.
    2. Create `backup-demo1-tidb-secret` to store the account and password to access the TiDB cluster:

        {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

        ```shell
        kubectl create secret generic backup-demo1-tidb-secret --from-literal=password=${password} --namespace=test1
        ```

### Step 2. Perform an ad-hoc backup

Depending on which method you choose to grant permissions to the remote storage when preparing for the ad-hoc backup, export your data to Azure Blob Storage by doing one of the following:

- Method 1: If you grant permissions by access key, create the `Backup` CR to back up cluster data as described below:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-azblob.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-azblob.yaml` is as follows:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-azblob
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      backupType: full
      br:
        cluster: demo1
        clusterNamespace: test1
        # logLevel: info
        # statusAddr: ${status_addr}
        # concurrency: 4
        # rateLimit: 0
        # timeAgo: ${time}
        # checksum: true
        # sendCredToTikv: true
        # options:
        # - --lastbackupts=420134118382108673
      # Only needed for TiDB Operator < v1.1.10 or TiDB < v4.0.8
      from:
        host: ${tidb_host}
        port: ${tidb_port}
        user: ${tidb_user}
        secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
      azblob:
        secretName: azblob-secret
        container: my-container
        prefix: my-folder
    ```

- Method 2: If you grant permissions by Azure AD, create the `Backup` CR to back up cluster data as described below:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-azblob.yaml
    ```

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    The content of `backup-azblob.yaml` is as follows:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-azblob
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      backupType: full
      serviceAccount: tidb-backup-manager
      br:
        cluster: demo1
        sendCredToTikv: false
        clusterNamespace: test1
        # logLevel: info
        # statusAddr: ${status_addr}
        # concurrency: 4
        # rateLimit: 0
        # timeAgo: ${time}
        # checksum: true
        # options:
        # - --lastbackupts=420134118382108673
      # Only needed for TiDB Operator < v1.1.10 or TiDB < v4.0.8
      from:
        host: ${tidb_host}
        port: ${tidb_port}
        user: ${tidb_user}
        secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
      azblob:
        secretName: azblob-secret-ad
        container: my-container
        prefix: my-folder
    ```

When configuring `backup-azblob.yaml`, note the following:

- Since TiDB Operator v1.1.6, if you want to back up data incrementally, you only need to specify the last backup timestamp `--lastbackupts` in `spec.br.options`. For the limitations of incremental backup, refer to [Use BR to Back up and Restore Data](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-tool#back-up-incremental-data).
- For more information about Azure Blob Storage configuration, refer to [Azure Blob Storage fields](backup-restore-cr.md#azure-blob-storage-fields).
- Some parameters in `.spec.br` are optional, such as `logLevel` and `statusAddr`. For more information about BR configuration, refer to [BR fields](backup-restore-cr.md#br-fields).
- For v4.0.8 or a later version, BR can automatically adjust `tikv_gc_life_time`. You do not need to configure `spec.tikvGCLifeTime` and `spec.from` fields in the `Backup` CR.
- For more information about the `Backup` CR fields, refer to [Backup CR fields](backup-restore-cr.md#backup-cr-fields).

After you create the `Backup` CR, TiDB Operator starts the backup automatically. You can view the backup status by running the following command:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl get bk -n test1 -o wide
```

## Scheduled full backup

You can set a backup policy to perform scheduled backups of the TiDB cluster, and set a backup retention policy to avoid excessive backup items. A scheduled full backup is described by a custom `BackupSchedule` CR object. A full backup is triggered at each backup time point. Its underlying implementation is the ad-hoc full backup.

### Step 1. Prepare for a scheduled full backup

The steps to prepare for a scheduled full backup are the same as those of [Prepare for an ad-hoc backup](#step-1-prepare-for-an-ad-hoc-backup).

### Step 2. Perform a scheduled full backup

Depending on which method you choose to grant permissions to the remote storage, perform a scheduled full backup by doing one of the following:

+ Method 1: If you grant permissions by access key, create the `BackupSchedule` CR, and back up cluster data as described below:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-scheduler-azblob.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-scheduler-azblob.yaml` is as follows:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: BackupSchedule
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-schedule-azblob
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      #maxBackups: 5
      #pause: true
      maxReservedTime: "3h"
      schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
      backupTemplate:
        backupType: full
        br:
          cluster: demo1
          clusterNamespace: test1
          # logLevel: info
          # statusAddr: ${status_addr}
          # concurrency: 4
          # rateLimit: 0
          # timeAgo: ${time}
          # checksum: true
          # sendCredToTikv: true
        # Only needed for TiDB Operator < v1.1.10 or TiDB < v4.0.8
        from:
          host: ${tidb_host}
          port: ${tidb_port}
          user: ${tidb_user}
          secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
        azblob:
          secretName: azblob-secret-ad
          container: my-container
          prefix: my-folder
    ```

+ Method 2: If you grant permissions by Azure AD, create the `BackupSchedule` CR, and back up cluster data as described below:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-scheduler-azblob.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-scheduler-azblob.yaml` is as follows:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: BackupSchedule
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-schedule-azblob
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      #maxBackups: 5
      #pause: true
      maxReservedTime: "3h"
      schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
      backupTemplate:
        backupType: full
        br:
          cluster: demo1
          sendCredToTikv: false
          clusterNamespace: test1
          # logLevel: info
          # statusAddr: ${status_addr}
          # concurrency: 4
          # rateLimit: 0
          # timeAgo: ${time}
          # checksum: true
        # Only needed for TiDB Operator < v1.1.10 or TiDB < v4.0.8
        from:
          host: ${tidb_host}
          port: ${tidb_port}
          user: ${tidb_user}
          secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
        azblob:
          secretName: azblob-secret-ad
          container: my-container
          prefix: my-folder
    ```

From the preceding content in `backup-scheduler-azblob.yaml`, you can see that the `backupSchedule` configuration consists of two parts. One is the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, and the other is `backupTemplate`.

- For the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, refer to [BackupSchedule CR fields](backup-restore-cr.md#backupschedule-cr-fields).
- `backupTemplate` specifies the configuration related to the cluster and remote storage, which is the same as the `spec` configuration of [the `Backup` CR](backup-restore-cr.md#backup-cr-fields).

After creating the scheduled full backup, you can run the following command to check the backup status:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl get bks -n test1 -o wide
```

You can run the following command to check all the backup items:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
kubectl get bk -l tidb.pingcap.com/backup-schedule=demo1-backup-schedule-azblob -n test1
```

## Delete the backup CR

If you no longer need the backup CR, you can delete it by referring to [Delete the Backup CR](backup-restore-overview.md#delete-the-backup-cr).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problem during the backup process, refer to [Common Deployment Failures](deploy-failures.md).
