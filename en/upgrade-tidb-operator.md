# Upgrade TiDB Operator and Kubernetes

This document describes how to upgrade TiDB Operator and Kubernetes.

## Upgrade TiDB Operator

1. Update [CRD (Custom Resource Definition)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/):

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/${version}/manifests/crd.yaml && \
    kubectl get crd tidbclusters.pingcap.com
    ```

    > **Note:**
    >
    > The `${version}` in this document represents the version of TiDB Operator, such as `v1.1.0`. You can check the currently supported version using the `helm search -l tidb-operator` command.

2. Get the `values.yaml` file of the `tidb-operator` chart that you want to install:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    mkdir -p /home/tidb/tidb-operator/${version} && \
    helm inspect values pingcap/tidb-operator --version=${version} > /home/tidb/tidb-operator/${version}/values-tidb-operator.yaml
    ```

3. Modify the `operatorImage` image in the `/home/tidb/tidb-operator/${version}/values-tidb-operator.yaml` file. Merge the customized configuration in the old `values.yaml` file with the `/home/tidb/tidb-operator/${version}/values-tidb-operator.yaml` file, and execute `helm upgrade`:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    helm upgrade tidb-operator pingcap/tidb-operator --version=${version} -f /home/tidb/tidb-operator/${version}/values-tidb-operator.yaml
    ```

    > **Note:**
    >
    > After TiDB Operator is upgraded, the `discovery` deployment in all TiDB clusters will automatically upgrade to the specified version of TiDB Operator.

## Upgrade TiDB Operator from v1.0 to v1.1 or later releases

Since TiDB Operator v1.1.0, PingCAP no longer updates or maintains the tidb-cluster chart. The components and features that have been managed using the tidb-cluster chart will be managed by CR (Custom Resource) or dedicated charts in v1.1. For more details, refer to [TiDB Operator v1.1 Notes](notes-tidb-operator-v1.1.md).

## Upgrade Kubernetes

When there is a major version upgrade of Kubernetes, you need to make sure that `kubeSchedulerImageTag` matches the version. By default, this value is generated by Helm during the installation or upgrade process. To reset this value, execute `helm upgrade`.
