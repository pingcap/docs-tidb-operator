# Performance of EBS Snapshot Backup and Restore

This document describes the performance of EBS snapshot backup and restore, the factors that affect performance, and the performance test results. The performance metrics are based on the AWS region `us-west-2`.

## Backup performance

This section introduces the performance of EBS snapshot backup using volumes, the factors that affect performance, and the performance test results.

### Backup time consumption

EBS snapshot backup using volumes consists of the following processes: creates a backup task, stops scheduling, disables GC, and obtains the backupts and volume snapshots. For more detailed information about these processes, see [Architecture of EBS snapshot volume backup and restore](volume-snapshot-backup-restore.md). Among these processes, creating a volume snapshot consumes most of the time. Volume snapshots are created in parallel, and the time taken to complete the entire backup task depends on when the most time-consuming volume is created.

### Time consumption ratio of backup

| Backup stage     | Time taken    | Total ratio | Remarks                                     |
| :--------: | :---------: | :------: | :-------------------------------------: |
| Create volume snapshots  | 16 minutes (50 GB) | 99%      | Including the time for creating AWS EBS snapshots                  |
| Others        | 1 second          | 1%       | Including the time for stopping scheduling, disabling GC, and obtaining the backupts |

### Backup performance data

Time taken by snapshot backup using volumes depends on when the last volume snapshot is backed up, which is done by AWS EBS. For now, AWS does not provide quantitative metrics for volume snapshot backup. The time taken by the entire backup process is as follows under the recommended machine type and GP3 storage volume, with the configuration of 400 MiB/s and 7000 IOPS:

| Volume data  | Total volume size  | Volume configuration             | Appropriate backup duration |
| :------: | :-----: | :---------------: | :--------: |
| 50 GB    | 500 GB  | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 20 minutes    |
| 100 GB   | 500 GB  | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 50 minutes    |
| 200 GB   | 500 GB  | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 100 minutes   |
| 500 GB   | 1024 GB | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 150 minutes   |
| 1024 GB  | 3500 GB | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 350 minutes   |

> **Note:**

> The preceding performance data is based on full data backup.

> AWS EBS snapshot backup is performed on the per volume basis. Only the first volume snapshot is full, and the subsequent volume snapshots are incremental. You can complete a daily backup within about 1 hour. In special scenarios, you can shorten the backup interval, for example, to 12 hours or 8 hours.

### Backup impact

It is tested that the backup impact on clusters in less than 3% when GP3 volumes are used. In the following figure, the backup is initiated after 10:25.

## Restore performance

This document describes the performance of EBS snapshot restore using volumes, the factors that affect performance, and the performance test results.

### Restore time consumption

EBS snapshot restore using volumes consists of the following processes. For detailed information, see [Architecture of EBS snapshot volume backup and restore](volume-snapshot-backup-restore.md).

1. Create a cluster.

    TiDB Operator creates a cluster in recoveryMode and starts all PD nodes.

2. Restore volumes.

    TiDB Operator creates volume restore subtasks using BR. BR restores the data volumes from the snapshots to start TiKV.

3. Start TiKV.

    TiDB Operator mounts the TiKV volumes and starts TiKV.

4. Restore data.

    TiDB Operator creates volume data restore subtasks. BR restores the data volumes to a consistent state.

5. Start TiDB.

    TiDB is started and the restore is completed.

### Time consumption ratio of restore

| Restore stage     | Appropriate time taken | Restore ratio | Remarks                                                            |
| :--------: | :---------: | :------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Creates clusters     | 30 seconds         |  2%      | Including the time for downloading docker image and starting PD                                   |
| Restores volumes     | 20 seconds         |  1%     | Including the time for starting the BR Pod and restoring volumes                                         |
| Starts TiKV   | 10 to 16 minutes    | 42%      | Including the time for starting RocksDB and reading the meta data of all Regions |
| Restores data | 2 to 20 minutes    | 52%       |  Including the time for restoring data in the Raft consensus layer and deleting MVCC data                                 |
| Starts TiDB   | 1 minute        | 3%       |  Including the time for downloading the tidb docker image and starting TiDB                                           |

> **Note:**
>
> Volume snapshots are consistent upon crash. To start TiKV and restore data during EBS volume snapshot restore, data needs to be initialized first, that is, to be downloaded from Amazon S3. The initialization takes no more than 30 minutes and can be shortened to less than 5 minutes if you use high-performance disks that can increase the IOPS and bandwidth. For details about how to use high-performance disks, see [Restore period is excessively long (longer than 2 hours)](backup-restore-faq.md#restore-period-is-excessively-long-longer-than-2-hours).

### Restore performance data

Time taken by snapshot restore using volumes mainly depends on the time taken by starting TiKV and restoring data. TiKV startup and data restore need to read volume data that is restored from snapshots. Such volume data is loaded with certain latency. Specifically, the data does not reach optimal performance immediately after restore. This is because the data is available only after it is downloaded from Amazon S3 and written to the volumes.

The data load latency results in high I/O operation latency when each block is accessed for the first time. Due to the impact of data load latency, TiKV startup and data restore consume most of the time in the whole process of snapshot restore using volumes. Test data is as follows under the recommended machine type and GP3 storage volume:

![EBS Snapshot restore perf](/media/volume-snapshot-restore-perf.png)

| Volume data  | Total volume size   | Volume configuration             | Appropriate restore duration |
| :------: | :-----: | :---------------: | :--------: |
| 50 GB    | 500 GB  | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 16 minutes    |
| 100 GB   | 500 GB  | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 18 minutes    |
| 200 GB   | 500 GB  | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 21 minutes   |
| 500 GB   | 1024 GB | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 25 minutes   |
| 1024 GB  | 3500 GB | 7000IOPS/400MiB/s | 34 minutes   |

> **Note:**
>
> The performance curve of data restore is not completely linear and monotonically increasing. This is because, although volume data is the user data used by TiKV, different volume blocks might be loaded and scanned to start TiKV and restore data. In addition, the network speed of downloading volume blocks from AWS might also affect the restore performance.
