# Renew and Replace the TLS Certificate

This document introduces how to renew and replace certificates of the corresponding components before certificates expire, taking TLS certificates between PD, TiKV, and TiDB components in the TiDB cluster as an example.

If you need to renew and replace certificates between other components in the TiDB cluster, TiDB server-side certificate, or MySQL client-side certificate, you can take similar steps to complete the operation.

The renewal and replacement operations in this document assume that the original certificates have not expired. If the original certificates expire or become invalid, to generate new certificates and restart the TiDB cluster, refer to [Enable TLS between TiDB components](enable-tls-between-components.md) or [Enable TLS for MySQL client](enable-tls-for-mysql-client.md).

## Renew and replace the certificate issued by `cert-manager`

If the original TLS certificate is issued by [the `cert-manager` system](enable-tls-between-components.md#using-cert-manager), and the original certificate has not expired, the procedure varies with whether to renew the CA certificate.

### Renew and replace the CA certificate and certificates between components

When you use `cert-manager` to issue the certificate, if you specify the `spec.renewBefore` of the `Certificate` resource, `cert-manager` can automatically update the certificate before it expires.

Although `cert-manager` can automatically renew the CA certificate and the corresponding Kubernetes Secret objects, it currently does not support merging the old and new CA certificates into a combined CA certificate to accept certificates issued by the new and old CA certificates at the same time. Therefore, during the process of renewing and replacing the CA certificate, the cluster components cannot authenticate each other via TLS.

> **Warning:**
>
> Because the components cannot accept certificates issued by the new and old CAs at the same time, during the process of renewing and replacing certificates, some components' Pods need to be recreated. This might cause some requests to access the TiDB cluster to fail.

The steps to renew and replace the CA certificates of PD, TiKV, TiDB and certificates between components are as follows.

1. The `cert-manager` automatically renews the CA certificate and the Kubernetes Secret object `${cluster_name}-ca-secret` before the certificate expires.

    `${cluster_name}` is the name of the cluster.

    To manually renew the CA certificate, you can directly delete the corresponding Kubernetes Secret objects and trigger `cert-manager` to regenerate the CA certificate.

2. Delete the Kubernetes Secret objects corresponding to the certificate of each component.

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl delete secret ${cluster_name}-pd-cluster-secret --namespace=${namespace}
    kubectl delete secret ${cluster_name}-tikv-cluster-secret --namespace=${namespace}
    kubectl delete secret ${cluster_name}-tidb-cluster-secret --namespace=${namespace}
    kubectl delete secret ${cluster_name}-cluster-client-secret --namespace=${namespace}
    ```

    In the above command, `${cluster_name}` is the name of the cluster, and `${namespace}` is the namespace in which the TiDB cluster is deployed.

3. Wait for `cert-manager` to issue new certificates for each component based on the new CA certificate.

    Observe the output of `kubectl get secret --namespace=${namespace}` until the Kubernetes Secret objects corresponding to all components are created.

4. Forcibly recreate the Pods of the PD, TiKV, and TiDB components in sequence.

    Because `cert-manager` does not support combined CA certificates, if you try to perform a rolling update of each component, the Pods using the different CAs to issue certificates cannot communicate with each other via TLS. Therefore, you need to delete the Pods forcibly and recreate the Pods based on the certificate issued by the new CA.

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```
    kubectl delete -n ${namespace} pod ${pod_name}
    ```

    In the above command, `${namespace}` is the namespace in which the TiDB cluster is deployed, and `${pod_name}` is the Pod name of each replica of PD, TiKV, and TiDB.

### Only renew and replace certificates between components

1. The `cert-manager` automatically updates the certificate of each component and the Kubernetes Secret object before the certificate expires.

    For PD, TiKV, and TiDB components, the namespace in which the TiDB cluster is deployed contains the following Kubernetes Secret objects:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```
    ${cluster_name}-pd-cluster-secret
    ${cluster_name}-tikv-cluster-secret
    ${cluster_name}-tidb-cluster-secret
    ${cluster_name}-cluster-client-secret
    ```

    In the above command, `${cluster_name}` is the name of the cluster.

    If you want to manually update the certificate between components, you can directly delete the corresponding Kubernetes Secret objects and trigger `cert-manager` to regenerate the certificate between components.

2. For certificates between components, each component automatically reloads the new certificates when creating the new connection later.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > - Currently, each component does not support [reload CA certificates](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/enable-tls-between-components#reload-certificates) manuallyï¼Œyou need to refer to [renew and replace the CA certificate and certificates between components](#renew-and-replace-the-ca-certificate-and-certificates-between-components).
    > - For the TiDB server-side certificate, you can manually reload by referring to any of the following methods:
    >     - Refer to [Reload certificate, key, and CA](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/enable-tls-between-clients-and-servers#reload-certificate-key-and-ca).
    >     - Refer to [Rolling restart the TiDB Cluster](restart-a-tidb-cluster.md) to perform a rolling restart of TiDB server.
