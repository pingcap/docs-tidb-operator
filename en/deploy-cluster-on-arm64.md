# Deploy a TiDB Cluster on ARM64 Machines

This document describes how to deploy a TiDB cluster on ARM64 machines (including AWS Graviton instances).

## Prerequisites

Before starting the process, make sure that Kubernetes clusters are deployed on your ARM64 machines. If Kubernetes clusters are not deployed, refer to [Deploy the Kubernetes cluster](deploy-tidb-operator.md#deploy-the-kubernetes-cluster).

## Deploy TiDB operator

* If your TiDB operator is v1.3.1 or later, [deploy TiDB Operator](deploy-tidb-operator.md) normally. You don't need to do the following to change images.

* If your TiDB operator is earlier than v1.3.1, the process of deploying TiDB operator on ARM64 machines is the same as the process of [Deploy TiDB Operator on Kubernetes](deploy-tidb-operator.md). The only difference is that, you should change the following configuration in the step [Customize TiDB operator deployment](deploy-tidb-operator.md#customize-tidb-operator-deployment): after getting the `values.yaml` file of the `tidb-operator` chart, you need to modify the `operatorImage` and `tidbBackupManagerImage` fields in that file to the ARM64 image versions. 
  
  ```yaml
  # ...
  operatorImage: pingcap/tidb-operator-arm64:v1.3.1
  # ...
  tidbBackupManagerImage: pingcap/tidb-backup-manager-arm64:v1.3.1
  # ...
  ```

## Deploy a TiDB cluster

* If your TiDB cluster is v5.4.2 or later, [deploy the TiDB cluster](deploy-on-general-kubernetes.md) normally. You don't need to do the following to change images.

* If your TiDB cluster is earlier than v5.4.2, the process of deploying a TiDB cluster on ARM64 machines is the same as the process of [Deploy TiDB in General Kubernetes](deploy-on-general-kubernetes.md). The only difference is that, in the TidbCluster definition file, you need to set the images of the related components to the ARM64 versions. 
  
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
  kind: TidbCluster
  metadata:
    name: ${cluster_name}
    namespace: ${cluster_namespace}
  spec:
    version: "v8.1.0"
    # ...
    helper:
      image: busybox:1.33.0
    # ...
    pd:
      baseImage: pingcap/pd-arm64
      # ...
    tidb:
      baseImage: pingcap/tidb-arm64
      # ...
    tikv:
      baseImage: pingcap/tikv-arm64
      # ...
    pump:
      baseImage: pingcap/tidb-binlog-arm64
      # ...
    ticdc:
      baseImage: pingcap/ticdc-arm64
      # ...
    tiflash:
      baseImage: pingcap/tiflash-arm64
      # ...
  ```

## Initialize a TiDB cluster

The process of initializing a TiDB cluster on ARM64 machines is the same as the process of [Initialize a TiDB Cluster on Kubernetes](initialize-a-cluster.md). The only difference is that you need to modify the `spec.image` field in the TidbInitializer definition file to the ARM64 image version. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
kind: TidbInitializer
metadata:
  name: ${initializer_name}
  namespace: ${cluster_namespace}
spec:
  image: kanshiori/mysqlclient-arm64
  # ...
```

## Deploy monitoring for a TiDB cluster

* If your TiDB cluster is v5.4.2 or later, [deploy monitoring and alerts](monitor-a-tidb-cluster.md) normally. You don't need to do the following to change images.
  
* If your TiDB cluster is earlier than v5.4.2, the process of deploying monitoring for a TiDB cluster on ARM64 machines is the same as the process of [Deploy Monitoring and Alerts for a TiDB Cluster](monitor-a-tidb-cluster.md). The only difference is that, you need to modify the `spec.initializer.baseImage` field in the TidbMonitor definition file to the ARM64 image.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
  kind: TidbMonitor
  metadata:
    name: ${monitor_name}
  spec:
    # ...
    initializer:
      baseImage: pingcap/tidb-monitor-initializer-arm64
      version: v5.4.1
    # ...
  ```
