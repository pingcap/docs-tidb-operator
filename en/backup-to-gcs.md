# Back up Data to GCS Using Dumpling

This document describes how to back up the data of the TiDB cluster on Kubernetes to [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/). "Backup" in this document refers to full backup (ad-hoc full backup and scheduled full backup).

The backup method described in this document is implemented using CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) in TiDB Operator v1.1 or later versions. [Dumpling](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/export-or-backup-using-dumpling) is used to get the logic backup of the TiDB cluster, and then this backup data is sent to the remote GCS.

Dumpling is a data export tool that exports data stored in TiDB/MySQL as SQL or CSV files and can be used to make a logical full backup or export.

## Usage scenarios

You can use the backup method described in this document if you want to make an [ad-hoc full backup](#ad-hoc-full-backup-to-gcs) or [scheduled full backup](#scheduled-full-backup-to-gcs) of the TiDB cluster data to GCS with the following needs:

- To export SQL or CSV files
- To limit the memory usage of a single SQL statement
- To export the historical data snapshot of TiDB

## Prerequisites

Before you use Dumpling to back up the TiDB cluster data to GCS, make sure that you have the following privileges:

* The `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges of the `mysql.tidb` table: Before and after the backup, the `Backup` CR needs a database account with these privileges to adjust the GC time.
* SELECT
* RELOAD
* LOCK TABLES
* REPLICATION CLIENT

## Ad-hoc full backup to GCS

Ad-hoc full backup describes a backup operation by creating a `Backup` custom resource (CR) object. TiDB Operator performs the specific backup operation based on this `Backup` object. If an error occurs during the backup process, TiDB Operator does not retry and you need to handle this error manually.

To better explain how to perform the backup operation, this document shows an example in which the data of the `demo1` TiDB cluster is backed up to the `test1` Kubernetes namespace.

### Step 1: Prepare for ad-hoc full backup

1. Download [backup-rbac.yaml](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/blob/master/manifests/backup/backup-rbac.yaml) and execute the following command to create the role-based access control (RBAC) resources in the `test1` namespace:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-rbac.yaml -n test1
    ```

2. Grant permissions to the remote storage.

    Refer to [GCS account permissions](grant-permissions-to-remote-storage.md#gcs-account-permissions).

3. Create the `backup-demo1-tidb-secret` secret which stores the root account and password needed to access the TiDB cluster:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic backup-demo1-tidb-secret --from-literal=password=${password} --namespace=test1
    ```

### Step 2: Perform ad-hoc backup

1. Create the `Backup` CR and back up data to GCS:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-gcs.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-gcs.yaml` is as follows:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-gcs
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      from:
        host: ${tidb_host}
        port: ${tidb_port}
        user: ${tidb_user}
        secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
      gcs:
        secretName: gcs-secret
        projectId: ${project_id}
        bucket: ${bucket}
        # prefix: ${prefix}
        # location: us-east1
        # storageClass: STANDARD_IA
        # objectAcl: private
        # bucketAcl: private
    # dumpling:
    #  options:
    #  - --threads=16
    #  - --rows=10000
    #  tableFilter:
    #  - "test.*"
      storageClassName: local-storage
      storageSize: 10Gi
    ```

    The example above backs up all data in the TiDB cluster to GCS. Some parameters in `spec.gcs` can be ignored, such as `location`, `objectAcl`, `bucketAcl`, and `storageClass`. For more information about GCS configuration, refer to [GCS fields](backup-restore-cr.md#gcs-fields).

    `spec.dumpling` refers to Dumpling-related configuration. You can specify Dumpling's operation parameters in the `options` field. See [Dumpling Option list](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dumpling-overview#option-list-of-dumpling) for more information. These configuration items of Dumpling can be ignored by default. When these items are not specified, the default values of `options` fields are as follows:

    ```
    options:
    - --threads=16
    - --rows=10000
    ```

    For more information about the `Backup` CR fields, refer to [Backup CR fields](backup-restore-cr.md#backup-cr-fields).

2. After creating the `Backup` CR, use the following command to check the backup status:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get bk -n test1 -owide
    ```

## Scheduled full backup to GCS

You can set a backup policy to perform scheduled backups of the TiDB cluster, and set a backup retention policy to avoid excessive backup items. A scheduled full backup is described by a custom `BackupSchedule` CR object. A full backup is triggered at each backup time point. Its underlying implementation is the ad-hoc full backup.

### Step 1: Prepare for scheduled backup

The preparation for the scheduled backup is the same as the [prepare for ad-hoc full backup](#step-1-prepare-for-ad-hoc-full-backup).

### Step 2: Perform scheduled backup

1. Create the `BackupSchedule` CR, and back up cluster data as described below:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f backup-schedule-gcs.yaml
    ```

    The content of `backup-schedule-gcs.yaml` is as follows:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
    kind: BackupSchedule
    metadata:
      name: demo1-backup-schedule-gcs
      namespace: test1
    spec:
      #maxBackups: 5
      #pause: true
      maxReservedTime: "3h"
      schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
      backupTemplate:
        from:
          host: ${tidb_host}
          port: ${tidb_port}
          user: ${tidb_user}
          secretName: backup-demo1-tidb-secret
        gcs:
          secretName: gcs-secret
          projectId: ${project_id}
          bucket: ${bucket}
          # prefix: ${prefix}
          # location: us-east1
          # storageClass: STANDARD_IA
          # objectAcl: private
          # bucketAcl: private
      # dumpling:
      #  options:
      #  - --threads=16
      #  - --rows=10000
      #  tableFilter:
      #  - "test.*"
        # storageClassName: local-storage
        storageSize: 10Gi
    ```

2. After creating the scheduled full backup, use the following command to check the backup status:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get bks -n test1 -owide
    ```

    Use the following command to check all the backup items:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get bk -l tidb.pingcap.com/backup-schedule=demo1-backup-schedule-gcs -n test1
    ```

From the example above, you can see that the `backupSchedule` configuration consists of two parts. One is the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, and the other is `backupTemplate`.

`backupTemplate` specifies the configuration related to the cluster and remote storage, which is the same as the `spec` configuration of [the `Backup` CR](backup-restore-cr.md#backup-cr-fields). For the unique configuration of `backupSchedule`, refer to [BackupSchedule CR fields](backup-restore-cr.md#backupschedule-cr-fields).

> **Note:**
>
> TiDB Operator creates a PVC used for both ad-hoc full backup and scheduled full backup. The backup data is stored in PV first and then uploaded to remote storage. If you want to delete this PVC after the backup is completed, you can refer to [Delete Resource](cheat-sheet.md#delete-resources) to delete the backup Pod first, and then delete the PVC.
>
> If the backup data is successfully uploaded to remote storage, TiDB Operator automatically deletes the local data. If the upload fails, the local data is retained.

## Delete the backup CR

After the backup, you might need to delete the backup CR. For details, refer to [Delete the Backup CR](backup-restore-overview.md#delete-the-backup-cr).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problem during the backup process, refer to [Common Deployment Failures](deploy-failures.md).
